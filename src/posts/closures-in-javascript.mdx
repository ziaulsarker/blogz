***Closures*** are a very powerfull technique we can use to do some preety neat stuff.

Basically closures just allow functions at the time of declaration have access to its outer lexical scope, even after its been invoked / executed. 

This opens up posibility to do some cools stuff like 
  - abstact logic
  - create private variables
  - supply arguments cronologically (currying / partial aplication)
