Sometimes websites are visited by people who need to navigate it using a keyboard rather then the traditional mouse, for example the visually impaired. 

These users navigate through the site using the the keyboard keys ex the tab key and shift + arrow keys are used kind of like a mouse to move to next tabbable elements with in the page chronologically. 

With that being said in modern web application semantically there can he a lot of html that gets generated and you can imagine how much a tabbing from a user that might take to get to something lower located within a site. This is where ship links comes in, skip links are visually hidden from the page and only appears on receiving focus, and when activated shits the focus to a another position of the site (usually another skip link or the main sections)

<Span>example: of a skip link</Span>
<div>
```html
<a href="#THE-ID-OF-THE-NEXT-ELEMENT-WHEN-CLICKED" class="skip-slink-styles">skip link</a>
```
</div>

<div>
```css
.skip-slink-styles: {
  position: absolute;
  left: auto;
  top: -100%vh;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  visibility: hidden;
