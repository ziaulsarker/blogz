The Temperatures parameter in LLM refers to the randomness / creativity of the response provided by the LLM. Now what does that mean, when we prompt a LLM we can set its temperature a lower temperature yields a more factual response which is more predictable, while a higher temperature indicates more randomness and inaccuracies.

use cases of **high temperature** should be when we we require more creativity from the llm, ex when we prompt the llm to for creative ideas, fictional storytelling, brainstorming

use case for **low temperatures** are when we require more precision, ex creating instructions, summarizing documents, when we require more factual answers. 


Typically temperature ranges from 0 - 1
