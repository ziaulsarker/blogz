Linux is very popular open source operating system, just like mac and windows you can use a graphical interface with it, but to trully harness the power or linux its reccomended to use its shell (command line interface). In windows its **cmd** and in mac its the **teminal**

Before i continue i want to go over what a command really is. Since Linux is vastly customizable, there are a lot of different variations of linx that share the core propgrams but also come with its own programs and user interface and look and feel. These variations are whats called ***distros*** (distributions), some popular distro are Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Linux Mint. A command is a way to run a program that runs on that distro usig the shell (command line interface). A command consits of that **programs name** along with any **options and/or arguments**.

Now a lot of us already use bacis file system commands in our day to day already like **ls** (list files), but these are some other ones i find usefull.
