Linux is very popular open source operating system, just like mac and windows you can use a graphical interface with it, but to trully harness the power or linux its reccomended to use its shell (command line interface). In windows its **cmd** and in mac its the **teminal**

Before i continue i want to go over what a command really is. Since Linux is vastly customizable, there are a lot of different variations of linx that share the core propgrams but also come with its own programs and user interface and look and feel. These variations are whats called ***distros*** (distributions), some popular distro are Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Linux Mint. A command is a way to run a program that runs on that distro usig the shell (command line interface). A command consits of that **programs name** along with any **options and/or arguments**.

Now a lot of us already use bacis file system commands in our day to day already like **ls** (list files), **mkdir** (make directory) but these are some other ones i find usefull.

<strong className="mt-4 bg-[#49c5b6] text-white dark:bg-[#e7b10a]">cat</strong> you ever want to read the contents of a file right inside your command line interface? well the cat command does just that, it prints the entirety of the file. It concatenates the file into one stdout (standard output).

<Span>`cat file`</Span>
<Span> &uarr; this will list the whole file content inside the terminal</Span>
