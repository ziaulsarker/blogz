Machine learning is broken down into 4 types, ***supervised***, ***unsupervised***, ***semi supervised***, and ***reinforce learning***. For the pourpose of this post we will be focusing on supervised learning. **Supervised learning** is also broken down into two types of problems, ***regression***, ***classification***

Typically when we are trying to frame / solve a machine learning problem we require a few things, some of which are, the ***features***, ***labels***, and ***hypothesis*** of our problem, 


**Features** (X) are bascially the relavent data that we can use to make a prediction about something. For example, lets say if we want to use AI to make a prediction about weather of not someone is sick, some ***fatures / inputs*** to make that prediction would be, the persons **age**, **weight**, **gender**, **family history**, **symptoms**, we can use this information to make a classification of if the person is sick of not (binary classification). Another example is if we are trying to make a prediction about what the value of our car will be if we try to sell it. Some ***features*** of this problem would be the **model**, **make**, **miles**, **color**, **condition** of the car.

**Labels** (Y) are the bascially the predictions that are derived from the features. Its what we want to predict for the given data instance. In a case of binary classification (if a person is sick / not sick) the ***label***. In the case of a linear regression (the price of a car) the label is the amount the car sold for.

**The Hypothesis** (h) is the function / algorithm that we pass the ***features*** into to get the  ***labels***. The hypothesis is the program that is learned form the data. (our prediction). In order find the most accurate prediction we can pass our features (X) throguh many hypothesis (h) to yeild the most accurate label (y).
