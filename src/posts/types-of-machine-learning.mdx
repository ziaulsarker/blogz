Machine learning can be a very broad subject and is typically categorized into 5 different types. 

1. supervised learning  
2. unsupervised learning 
3. semi-supervised learning  
4. self-supervised learning  
5. reinforced learning

**<u>Supervised learning</u>** 
to simply put is when we gather a set of features (X) and with theses features produce a label (y) which is the answer or prediction or classification. This is where the machine learns form given the right answers. 
for example lets say we want to know the price of a car, we first gather the data lets say car model, make, mileage(features / X), etc and we predict the price (label / y).
we do this by training the our model with a data set of cars and their prices. 


*some typical types of supervised leaning algorithms are **regression** and **classification***

<br/>

**<u>Unsupervised learning</u>** is very similar to supervised learning except we don't provide the model with the labels (y) and only the features(X). We can try to get the 
Ml algorithm to find patterns in the data. For example lets say i feed my algorithm with data about visitors to my site and then try to predict some patterns in the data for example when users visit, their locations, etc and then try to make some predictions about my visitors based on the features provided.


*some typical types of unsupervised learning algorithms are **clustering**, **anomaly detection**, **dimensionality reduction / feature extraction***
