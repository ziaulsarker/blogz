In a programing context a recursion is just a function that calls itself. 

In orders to trully understand recursion we need to familiarize our selfs with a data structure called a <strong><em> stack</em> </strong> and the javascript <em><strong>event loop</strong></em>,

A <strong><em> stack</em> </strong>, is a <strong><em>LIFO (last in first out)</em></strong> data structure similiar to a javascript arrays or a python lists with an exception that we can only add / remove items from the top of the stack or the last item if you think of arrays / lists
