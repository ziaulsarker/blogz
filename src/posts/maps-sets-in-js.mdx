Maps were introduced as a new data structure in ES6. It is similar to a regular JS object as its a key-value pair store, but the main difference is that Maps allows you to use keys of any type while traditional Objects only allow strings.

<Span> example: </Span>
<div className="bg-[#282a36] p-4">
```javascript
  const objAsKey = {key: 'key', value: 'value'};
  const obj = {}

  obj[objAsKey] = 'foo'

  console.log(obj) // this results in {[object Object]: 'foo'}
```
</div>
