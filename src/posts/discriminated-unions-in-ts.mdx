A discriminated union in typescript is a a feature that allows you to create variations of a type that shares a union. 

<Span>example: </Span>
<div>
```typescript
// create a shared interface between the two types
interface SharedBioProps {
  src?: string;
}

// one type has children and type of never for its union type
interface BioWtihChildren extends SharedBioProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  title?: never;
  text?: never
}

// this union type has text and title and children is of type never.
interface BioWithTitleAndText extends SharedBioProps {
  children?: never;
  title: string
  text: string;
}

// here we creat the discriminated union. 
type BioProps = BioWtihChildren | BioWithTitleAndText;

export default BioProps;
```
</div>
<div>
```typescript
// here we import the type and us as our props interface in our react app
import BioProps from './bioProps.ts'
function BioComonent(props: BioProps) {
  const { src = "", title, text, children } = props;
  return (
    <article>
      {src && (
          <Avatar
            src={src}
          />
      )}

      {children ? (
        children
      ) : (
        <div>
          <h3>{title}</h3>
          <p>{text}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </article>
  )
}
```
</div>
