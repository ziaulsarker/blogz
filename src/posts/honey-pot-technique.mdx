In the context of computer science a honey pot works as a security mechanism to bait spam bot and potential attackers into thinking they have compromised your machine. 

This technique is often times used with HTML forms to prevent bots from spaming your site.

The idea is when a bot goes through your site, it fills out any forms it can find to spam your site with fake data so we create a "Honey Pot" to bait them we do this by creating a hidden form field on our forms which is visually hidden so a real user wont fill out that field but a bot will, and on the form submission we can check if that form field was filled out. If it was then we know it was a bot and we can reject submission.

There are a few way to acheive this 
  - css to hide the field
  - using input type hidden

so lets say we have a form to capture new users on a site.

```html
<form id='signup-form'>
  <input type='text' name='username' />
  <input type='email' name='email' />
  <input type='password' name='password' />

  <!-- we create the honepot field -->
  <input type='text' name='user-name' class='user-name'/> 
   <!--  this field will be hidden from the user visually, so they only see and fill out the fields above -->
   <!-- a bot will scand your site, see this field and fill it out  -->

   <input type='submit' value='sign up' /> 
   <!-- we need to hide this visually from a used -->
</form>
```

we need to now hide the honey pot field from the user visually, we can either use the form type hidden but bot are getting smarter so css is a better solution in my opinion.

```css
.user-name {
  visibility : hidden;
  opacity : 0;
  display: none;
}
```

we approach above works fine but i like to not keep the form field hidden but rather be on the screen just not in visibility. Another approach is to give it position absolute and use a directtion that makes it out of the visibility of the viewport. This way if the bot is smart enough it might pick up on the hidden css properties so i find the approach that below a better solution.

```css
.user-name {
  position: absolute;
  right: 99999px;
}
```

so now we can validate if that field has a value at the time of the form submission and if it has a value then reject the submission.

```javascript
const myform = document.getElementById('signup-form');

myform.addEventListener('submit', event => {
  const formData = new FormData(event.target)

  // here we will check to if the honey pot field was filled out. and perform the necessary validatidating.
  const honePotHasData = formData.get('user-name'); // check to if the honey pot has worked and baited the bot.


 // validate the data
  if(honePotHasData) {
    // usually if the honey pot has data you dont want to submit that information to your database most tend to just return nothing but i prefe we dont save the data but still return a successfull msg that way the bot thinks it got a good submission.
    return null
  }
})
```
