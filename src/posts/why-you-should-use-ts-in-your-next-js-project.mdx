Javascript out of the box is a dynamic programing language, but does not provide great tooling and type safety like some typed languages. This is where typescript shines. 

Typescript provides a type system to existin javascript. Our variable can now have a types and interfaces associated with them. Typescript also provides a great tooling system, for our IDEs, some of which are autocomplete, type annotations, etc.

One thing to keep in mind is that **"all javascript is considered typescript but not all typescript is considered javascript"**. This makes it very easy to migrate existion javascript projects to typescript, all we have to do is update the .js/.jsx file extension to .ts/.tsx and thats it.

With typescripts type annotations, we are able to spot bugs in our code sooner for example.

<Span> example: accessing undefined properties using JS</Span>
<div>
```javascript
const me = {name: 'ziaul', hobby: 'code code code', location: 'NYC'}

console.log(me.age) // this code will run with out indicating any errors, it will just print undefined 
```
</div>

the same code in typeScript below will produce the following
<div>
```typescript
const me = {name: 'ziaul', hobby: 'code code code', location: 'NYC'}

console.log(me.age) // this code will indicate an error in the IDE
```
</div>
Property 'age' does not exist on type **'{"name: string; hobby: string; location: string;"}'** As you can see Typescript helps us identify the issue before we run the code.
